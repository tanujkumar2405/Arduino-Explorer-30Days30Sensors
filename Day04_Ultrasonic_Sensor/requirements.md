## 2. üîå Wiring Connections

| HC-SR04 Pin | Connect To           |
| ----------- | -------------------- |
| VCC         | 5V on Arduino        |
| GND         | GND on Arduino       |
| TRIG        | Digital Pin 9 (D9)   |

## 3. üíæ Software Requirements

- Arduino IDE

    - Version: 1.8.x or 2.x+

    - [Download Here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)

- **Libraries Used**: None external. Everything used is built into the Arduino IDE.

## 4. üß™ Online Simulation (Optional but Recommended)

If you don‚Äôt have the physical hardware, simulate it online:

- **Platform**: [Tinkercad Circuits](https://www.tinkercad.com/)

- **Steps**:

    1. Sign in to Tinkercad

    2. Go to ‚ÄúCircuits‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúCreate New Circuit‚Äù

    3. Add:

        - Arduino UNO

        - HC-SR04 Sensor

        - Breadboard

        - Connect as per schematic

    4. Use the built-in code editor and paste the code

    5. Simulate and observe distance output in Serial Monitor

## 5. üß† Concepts Covered

| Level        | Concept                                                |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Beginner     | Digital Pins, Serial Monitor, Ultrasonic Principles    |
| Intermediate | Time-to-Distance Conversion, Precision Timing          |
| Advanced     | Obstacle Avoidance, Real-time Feedback with Buzzer/LED |

## 6. ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works (Quick Summary)

1. The **TRIG** pin is set HIGH briefly to emit an ultrasonic pulse.

2. The **ECHO** pin listens for the reflected sound.

3. The Arduino calculates the time taken for the echo and converts it into distance using:

```nginx
distance (cm) = (duration in microseconds) / 58.2
```

## 7. üìå Troubleshooting Tips

| Issue                        | Solution                                                          |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| No reading on Serial Monitor | Check COM port and baud rate, ensure sensor is connected properly |
| Always reads 0 cm            | Object may be too far or sensor is not facing it                  |
| Fluctuating values           | Add delay(100) or use average of multiple readings                |
