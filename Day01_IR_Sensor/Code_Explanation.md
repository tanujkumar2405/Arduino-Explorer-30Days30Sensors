# üß† Full Code Explanation ‚Äì Day 01: IR Obstacle Sensor with Arduino Nano

This file provides a **line-by-line, detailed explanation** of the Arduino code used to detect obstacles using an IR sensor with Arduino Nano.

---

## üìÑ Arduino Code

```cpp
int irSensor = 2;   // IR Sensor Output pin connected to D2
int led = 13;       // On-board LED on pin 13

void setup() {
  pinMode(irSensor, INPUT);
  pinMode(led, OUTPUT);
  Serial.begin(9600); // Start serial communication
}

void loop() {
  int obstacle = digitalRead(irSensor);

  if (obstacle == LOW) { // Object detected
    digitalWrite(led, HIGH);
    Serial.println("üöß Obstacle Detected!");
  } else {
    digitalWrite(led, LOW);
    Serial.println("‚úÖ Clear Path");
  }

  delay(500);
}
```

## üß© Line-by-Line Explanation


### ***int irSensor = 2;***

- Declares an integer variable named `irSensor`.

- Assigns it pin number D2 where the IR sensor output pin is connected.


---


### ***int led = 13;***

- Declares an integer variable named `led`.

- Pin 13 is used for the on-board LED on the Arduino Nano.


---


### ***void setup()***

- This special Arduino function runs once when the Arduino is powered on or reset.

- It's used to initialize pins and communication.


---


### ***pinMode(irSensor, INPUT);***

- Configures pin D2 as input.

- Arduino will read signals from the sensor.


---


### ***pinMode(led, OUTPUT);***

- Configures pin 13 as output.

- Used to control the built-in LED ‚Äî ON or OFF.


---


### ***Serial.begin(9600);***

- Starts serial communication with your computer at a baud rate of 9600 bits/sec.

- Required for printing to the Serial Monitor (for debugging or display).


---


### ***void loop()***

- Another special Arduino function.

- This runs again and again as long as the Arduino is powered.

- It contains the main logic of the program.


---


### ***int obstacle = digitalRead(irSensor);***

- Reads the digital signal from the IR sensor using `digitalRead()`.

- Returns `HIGH` (1) if no object is detected, or `LOW` (0) if an object is in front.

- Stores this value in variable `obstacle`.


---


### ***if (obstacle == LOW)***

- Checks if the sensor detected an object.

- IR sensors typically output LOW when an object is detected.


---


### ***digitalWrite(led, HIGH);***

- Turns the LED ON by sending 5V to pin 13.


---


### ***Serial.println("üöß Obstacle Detected!");***

- Prints this message to the Serial Monitor.

- Helpful for real-time debugging and visibility.


---


### ***else { ... }***

- If no object is detected, the code inside the `else` block runs:

    - Turns OFF the LED: `digitalWrite(led, LOW);`

    - Prints `‚úÖ Clear Path` to Serial Monitor.


---


### ***delay(500);***

- Waits for 500 milliseconds before repeating the loop.

- Helps slow down the messages on Serial Monitor and avoid flooding.

## üß† Summary of Code Logic  


1. Set pin modes and start serial communication.

2. Continuously check the sensor's output.

3. If obstacle detected ‚Üí turn on LED, print message.

4. If not ‚Üí turn off LED, print alternate message.

5. Wait half a second and repeat.


---


## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Tips

- If LED never turns on, try placing your hand closer.

- Adjust the IR sensor‚Äôs range potentiometer (small blue screw).

- Make sure GND and 5V are properly connected.

- Try printing `obstacle` directly to see raw values: `Serial.println(obstacle);`
