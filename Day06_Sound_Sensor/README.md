# 🎧 Day 6: Sound Sensor – Sound Detection Project

Welcome to **Day 6** of the **"Arduino Explorer: 30 Days, 30 Sensors"** series!

Today, we’re exploring the **Sound Sensor** – a module that detects ambient sound intensity. It helps us understand sound-based triggers, such as clapping or noise-based automation.

## ⚙️ Working Principle

The **sound sensor** consists of a microphone, signal conditioning circuit, and sometimes a comparator. It converts sound pressure waves into electrical signals. When the detected sound surpasses a certain threshold, it sends a HIGH or analog signal to the microcontroller.

## 🔌 Circuit Diagram

- **VCC** → 5V on Arduino  
- **GND** → GND on Arduino  
- **A0** → A0 on Arduino (for analog signal reading)  
- **LED (optional)** → D13 with a resistor in series

📷 Refer to the `wiring_diagram.png` and `Schematic View.pdf` for visual guidance.

🔌 Refer to the `connection_info.md` for clear and detailed understanding.

## 🧠 Logic & Flow

1. Read analog value from the sensor.
2. Check if the value exceeds a defined threshold.
3. If yes, trigger LED ON or display message on Serial Monitor.

## 💻 Code Overview

The main sketch `sound_sensor.ino` includes:

- Pin declarations  
- Analog signal reading  
- Threshold comparison  
- Serial output and/or LED blinking
