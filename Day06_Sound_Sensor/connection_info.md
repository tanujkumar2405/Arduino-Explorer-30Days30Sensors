# üîå Circuit Diagram: Sound Sensor with Arduino Uno
<br>  

This circuit helps you connect a Sound Sensor module with an **LED** to visualize sound detection.

## üß∞ Required Components:

- Arduino Uno (or compatible)

- Sound Sensor Module (KY-038 or LM393-based)

- 1x LED

- 1x 220Œ© Resistor

- Jumper Wires

- Breadboard

<br>  

> **NOTE**: Since TinkerCad not builtin `Sound Sensor`, So we used `Potentiometer` as on its place.

## üìä Sound Sensor Pinout (LM393-based typical):

| Pin on Sensor | Label        | Connects To          |
| ------------- | ------------ | -------------------- |
| 1             | AO (Analog)  | A0 on Arduino        |
| 2             | GND          | GND on Arduino       |
| 3             | VCC          | 5V on Arduino        |
| 4 (optional)  | DO (Digital) | (Optional, not used) |

## üîå LED Connection:

| LED Pin               | Connects To                     |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Longer leg (Anode)    | Digital Pin 8 via 220Œ© resistor |
| Shorter leg (Cathode) | GND                             |

## üß† Working Logic:

- The **analog output (AO)** of the sound sensor sends values based on sound intensity.

If the sound crosses a certain threshold, the Arduino turns **ON** the LED.

Otherwise, the LED remains **OFF**.

## üß™ Tinkercad Tips:

- Use **KY-038** sensor in Tinkercad.

- Simulate sound by adjusting the analog input slider during simulation.

- Watch the LED respond as the analog value increases.

## Additionally

Using a potentiometer as a stand-in for a sound sensor in Tinkercad. Here‚Äôs how to connect the three pins on the potentiometer:

### üõ†Ô∏è Potentiometer Pin Mapping:

| Potentiometer Pin      | Connect To        | Description                     |
| ---------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Terminal 1**         | GND               | One end of the resistor         |
| **Terminal 2**         | 5V                | The other end of the resistor   |
| **Wiper (middle pin)** | Digital Pin 2 (D2) | Simulate digital HIGH/LOW signal |

<br>  
---

### üß†üîÑ Adjust the Potentiometer

When the wiper voltage is below ~2.5V, digitalRead(D2) will likely read LOW (0).

When the wiper voltage is above ~2.5V, digitalRead(D2) will likely read HIGH (1).

So, rotating the knob simulates sound being detected or not.
---

### ‚úÖ Tinkercad Setup Steps:

1. Drag a **potentiometer** from the components list.

2. Connect:

    - **Terminal 1** ‚Üí **GND (black wire)**

    - **Terminal 2** ‚Üí **5V (red wire)**

    - **Wiper (middle)** ‚Üí **D2 (Green Wire)**

3. Load your original code ‚Äî it will now respond to your potentiometer's position like it‚Äôs a sound sensor.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Normally, potentiometers connect to analog pins, but since your code expects **digital input**, we‚Äôll use the wiper to feed D2.

---

### Optional Tip:

If you want to simulate **sudden claps or spikes**, turn the knob quickly past the mid-point to simulate a HIGH signal, then back to LOW.
