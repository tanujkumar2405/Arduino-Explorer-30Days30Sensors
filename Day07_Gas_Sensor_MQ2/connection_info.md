## üìä MQ2 Gas Sensor Pinout:

| Pin on MQ2 Module | Description                | Connects To (Arduino)      |
| ----------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| VCC               | Power Supply (+5V)         | 5V                         |
| GND               | Ground                     | GND                        |
| AOUT              | Analog Output (Gas Levels) | A0                         |
| DOUT *(optional)* | Digital Output (threshold) | *Not used in this project* |
<br>

> üí° **Note**: We are using the **Analog Output (AOUT)** to get precise gas readings.

## üîå Wiring Tips:

- Use **breadboard** and **jumper wires** to easily connect components.

- **Double-check** VCC and GND pins for each component to prevent reverse polarity damage.

- Keep the **sensor elevated** on the breadboard for better airflow and accurate detection.

## Additionally

**If you are using tinkercad then connection to be remenber**:

This device has six wire leads. Power the heater by connecting +5V to either H1 or H2, and ground to the other. The resistance between A and B changes with the amount of gas detected. Connect one side of your detection circuit to A1 or A2, and the other to B1 or B2.

> **Note**: Refer [`Tinkercad_Simulation_Guide.md`](./Tinkercad_Simulation_Guide.md) for more detailed connection with this sensor (which has 6 Pins).
