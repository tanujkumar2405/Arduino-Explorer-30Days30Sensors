## ‚ö†Ô∏è Safety Tips:

- Run the system in a **well-ventilated area** during testing.

The MQ2 sensor needs **1‚Äì2 minutes of preheating** after powering up to give accurate results.

Ensure **secure** and **solid connections** to avoid false alarms.

Do not expose to open **flames** while testing.
